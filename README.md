# Robust Testing using Lq-Likelihood

This package implements a robust hypothesis testing procedure: the 
Lq-likelihood-ratio-type test (LqRT), introduced in Qin and Priebe (2017).
The code replicates and extends the R package which can be found here
[here](http://homepages.uc.edu/~qinyn/LqLR/).

## Installation

In order to install the package one needs to have python 3.x installed, then
either clone the repository from github and install using pip:
```
git clone https://github.com/alyakin314/lqrt
cd lqrt
pip install .
```
on install directly via pip:
```
pip install lqrt
```



## Import
The recommended import line is 
```python
>>> import lqrt
```
All examples below are performed using this import line.

(All examples also assume the usage of numpy and scipy.stats imported as:
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from scipy import stats
```
This is unnecessary for the actual usage of the package, only for examples)


## Usage
There are three tests implemented in this repostory: Single sample, related 
samples (also known as paired) and independent samples (also known as 
unpaired). 

### Single sample
The single sample test performs the Lq-Likelihood-test for the mean of one group
of scores.
It is a robust two-sided test for the null hypothesis that the expected 
value (mean) of a sample of independent observations is equal to the given
population mean.
It can be thought of the as a robust version of the single sample t-test
(`scipy.stats.ttest_1samp`).

#### Example:

Test if mean of random sample is equal to true mean, and different mean. We
reject the null hypothesis in the second case and donâ€™t reject it in the first
case.
```python
>>> np.random.seed(314)

>>> rvs1 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(0, 1, 50)

>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(rvs1, 0)
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=0.02388120731922072, pvalue=0.85)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(rvs1, 1)
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=35.13171144154751, pvalue=0.0)
```

### Related samples
The related samples test performs the Lq-Likelihood-test for the mean of 
two related samples of scores.
It is a robust two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent 
samples have identical average (expected) values.
It can be thought of as a robust version of the paired t-test 
(`scipy.stats.ttest_rel`).

#### Example:
A related samples test between two samples with identical means:
```python
>>> np.random.seed(314)

>>> rvs1 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(0, 1, 50)
>>> rvs2 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(0, 1, 50)

>>> lqrt.lqrtest_rel(rvs1, rvs2)
Lqrtest_relResult(statistic=0.22769245832813567, pvalue=0.66)
```

A related samples test between two samples with different means:

```python
>>> rvs3 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(1, 1, 50)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_rel(rvs1, rvs3)
Lqrtest_relResult(statistic=27.827284933987784, pvalue=0.0)
```

### Independent samples
The independent samples tests performes the Lq-Likelihood-test for the mean
 of two independent samples of scores.
It is a robust two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent
samples have identical average (expected) values. 
it can be thought of as a robust version of the unparied t-test 
(`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`).
One can perform the test with or without the assumption that the samples have
 equal variance, which is estimated together. 
This is accomplished by setting the equal\_variance flag, similar to scipy's
t-test.

#### Example:
Test with samples with identical means with and without the equal variance
assumption. Note that in the unpaired set-up the samples need not to have
the same size:
```python
>>> np.random.seed(314)

>>> rvs1 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(0, 1, 50)
>>> rvs2 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(0, 1, 70)

>>> lqrt.lqrtest_ind(rvs1, rvs2)
LqRtest_indResult(statistic=0.00046542438241203854, pvalue=0.99)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_ind(rvs1, rvs2, equal_var=False)
LqRtest_indResult(statistic=0.00047040017227573117, pvalue=0.97)
```

Test with samples with different means with and without the equal variance
assumption:

```python
>>> rvs3 = stats.multivariate_normal.rvs(1, 1, 70)

>>> lqrt.lqrtest_ind(rvs1, rvs3)
LqRtest_indResult(statistic=31.09168298440227, pvalue=0.0)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_ind(rvs1, rvs3, equal_var=False)
LLqRtest_indResult(statistic=31.251454446588696, pvalue=0.0)
```

### q parameter
All test functions have an argument q which specifies the q parameter of 
the Lq-likelihood. The q should typically be within [0.5, 1.0] and the 
lower value is associated with a more robust test. If left unspecified of
set to None, the q is estimated using the empirical approximation to the
trace of the assymptotic covariance matrix procedure specified in Qin and
Priebe (2017).

#### Example:
```python
>>> x_true = np.random.normal(0.34, 1, 40)
>>> x_contamination = np.random.normal(0.34, 1, 10)
>>> x_sample = np.concatenate([x_true, x_contamination])

>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x_sample, 0, q = 0.9)
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=1.1440379636073885, pvalue=0.28)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x_sample, 0, q = 0.6)
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=3.710699836358458, pvalue=0.08)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x_sample, 0)
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=5.5937088664291394, pvalue=0.06)
```

### Critical Value Bootstrap
The critical value for the tests is obtained via a bootstrap procedure, 
outlined in Qin and Priebe (2017). By default - 100 resamples are used,
but the number can be changed. Increasing the number of samples increases
the precision of the p-value, but adds on computational work.

#### Example:
```python
>>> x = np.random.normal(0, 1, 50)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x, 0) # takes ~0.25s
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=0.36665186821102225, pvalue=0.58)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x, 0, bootstrap=1000) # takes ~1.5s
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=0.36665186821102225, pvalue=0.541)
>>> lqrt.lqrtest_1samp(x, 0, bootstrap=10000) # takes ~15s
Lqrtest_1sampResult(statistic=0.36665186821102225, pvalue=0.5483)
```
